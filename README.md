# Pneumonia-Classification-on-TPU

This repository contains code for a deep learning model that classifies chest X-ray images into two classes: normal and pneumonia. The model is built using the TensorFlow framework and is optimized for running on Google Cloud's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit).

## Dataset
The model is trained on the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset contains a total of 5,856 chest X-ray images, with 3,680 images showing signs of pneumonia and 1,920 images labeled as normal.

## Conclusion
We hope that this repository will be useful for those interested in building and training deep learning models for medical image classification. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
